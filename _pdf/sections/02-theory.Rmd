## Beyond Content and Focus: Emotions in Campaigns {#emotionsincampaigns}
In democracies, parties and their representatives are lifted into positions of power through elections [@falterHandbuchWahlforschung2014, 11]. To be successful in these, they invest a lot of time and money in campaigns, which include the “*organizational, programmatic and public relations efforts by individual candidates or organizations running for office, e.g., political parties, aimed at informing, mobilizing and winning over eligible voters.*”   [@schmidtWoerterbuchZurPolitik2010, 878]. The goal here is simple: political actors try to convince voters of their policy proposals and candidates to gain votes in the upcoming election and thereby political power. To what extent and how campaigns impact election results is the subject of campaign research [@schoenWahlkampfforschung2014, 662 - 63] the field to which this work contributes.

While trying to help their candidate or party win, campaigners make strategic decisions, e.g., which tools to use, whom to target, what to talk about, etc. [@grossGamePracticalGuide2016, 3]. This is reflected in the complex structure of modern political campaigns, which employ a multitude of communication outlets. Party representatives and candidates, for instance, go on campaign tours, seek direct contact and interaction with voters, give speeches at rallies, participate in televised debates, and conduct press conferences. In addition to these direct means, campaigns also try to disseminate their messages, plans, and goals through newspapers, television, radio, and social media. Each outlet is carefully chosen for its ability to reach specific demographics, with the message tailored to suit the medium, hoping to evoke resonance with the targeted audience. In regard to analyzing campaigns, previous research mainly focused on two aspects: *campaign content* and *campaign focus* [@crabtreeItNotOnly2020: 1046]. The former explores the themes and issues addressed by politicians and parties, while the latter examines whether parties or political actors highlight themselves or their opponents in their campaigns. However, my research contributes to an increasing body of literature exploring a third dimension: the strategic use of emotions, i.e. *campaign sentiment* [@crabtreeItNotOnly2020: 1046].

It is indisputable that content and focus are essential in understanding campaigns, nevertheless significance lies not just in the message or subject, but also in the manner of its emotive framing [@utychNegativeAffectiveLanguage2018, 91]. 
Candidates do much more than provide a rational explanation of their policies and views on their competitors; they employ emotional tactics to evoke the feelings of the voters and thereby gain their support. Politicians seem to have some sense about the central role of emotional appeals in the cognitive process of persuasion [@fennisPsychologyAdvertising2016, 239] and use them constantly [@braderCampaigningHeartsMinds2006, 23]. Therefore, to fully grasp political campaigns, it is imperative to understand the  communicated emotions. An approach that numerous scholars adopted, exploring how, e.g. they influence voters' behaviors, such as: engagement, participation, information [@freedmanCampaignAdvertisingDemocratic2004; @marcusAffectiveIntelligencePolitical2000; @marcusAnxietyEnthusiasmVote1993; @valentinoElectionNightAlright2011; @valentinoWorriedCitizenGood2008; @weberEmotionsCampaignsPolitical2013], communication [@choCampaignTonePolitical2013] and (mostly gendered) evaluation of politicians [@hargraveDoubleStandardGender2023; @boussalisGenderCandidateEmotional2021; @gleasonMerePresenceGender2020]. Much of this research suggests strong effects, outlining the potential power of emotions, which led scholars to examine more closely how political actors strategically leverage emotive appeals [@crabtreeItNotOnly2020; @ridoutItMyCampaign2011; @naiGoingNegativeWorldwide2020; @naiFearLoathingPopulist2021; @widmannHowEmotionalAre2021].

### Emotive Strategies {#emotivestrategies}
In this regard, @crabtreeItNotOnly2020 presented one of the most comprehensive research projects that comparatively analyzed the strategic use of emotive language in party manifestos during elections in multiparty systems.^[This publication serves largely as a template for my study, where particularly the theoretical and methodological approaches are adopted.]
The authors contend that parties and their functionaries strategically utilize emotions to portray the state of the world in either a positive or negative light. This assumption is based on the idea of *retrospective voting behavior*, whereby voters are not just influenced by campaigns and parties' plans for the future, but cast their vote based on their approval or disapproval of the incumbents' past performance [@keyResponsibleElectorateRationality1966]. Albeit the model mostly being thought of and tested in regard of a country's economic situation, the argument works for all political spheres: After a legislative period comes to an end, voters draw a conclusion. Has the incumbent party done what they expected it to do? How is the country doing, what is the status quo? In case of a positive perception, voters are more likely to vote for the incumbent party, while a negative one tends to swing them towards the opposition [@plesciaRetrospectiveVotingParty2017]. As a consequence, parties are incentivized to influence the perception of the status quo to their advantage [@vavreckMessageMattersEconomy2009]. They do this through substantive content within their campaigns, e.g. incumbent parties highlighting successful projects and policies they introduced. However, @crabtreeItNotOnly2020 argue that as well, and just as important, party representatives use emotive language to frame the perception of the status quo. For a clearer understanding, I present the primary argument once more in Figure `@ref(fig:theory)`.

```{r theory, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Theoretical Argument", fig.pos="H", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/danielkuhlen/Desktop/uni/ba/02_data/03_tables_figures/theoreticalargument.png")
```
\vspace{-.5cm}
To test their argument, @crabtreeItNotOnly2020 conduct a sentiment analysis of party manifestos, which, I argue, is not a suitable research object in this case. The influence of party manifestos on electoral outcomes is definitely up for debate [@kercherWahlprogrammeAlsPflichtubung2013, 269]. Only a small segment of eligible voters actually reads them [@adamsAnybodyListeningEvidence2011, 379], which likely stems from their complex writing style and intimidating volume. For instance, during the 2021 German federal election, anyone aiming to read all the relevant party manifestos would be faced with 974 pages and 315,286 words.^[For this, I compiled the manifestos and counted the words using the *LIWC* software.] Even for a so-called politically informed citizens with a lot of spare time, this seems like a rather daunting task. All of this leaves the impression that thinking of party manifestos as one of the crucial campaign communication tools might be a bit outdated. As a consequence, I argue that it is not the sentiment expressed in party manifestos that shapes voters' perception of the political state of affairs, but rather other campaign messages such as televised debates, public speeches and social media posts - especially Twitter.

### Campaigning on Twitter {#campaigningtwitter}
Modern politics is practically unimaginable right now without Twitter. The platform acts as a key channel of communication for politicians and public figures throughout electoral campaigns [@castanhosilvaPoliticiansUnleashedPolitical2022; @jungherrTwitterUseElection2016; @konigEPINetzTwitterPoliticians2022; @muellerTwitterMadeMe2022; @stierElectionCampaigningSocial2018]. Twitter not only offers the opportunity to directly engage with a substantial portion of the voters, but also serves as a multiplier for message dissemination, as the media frequently picks up tweets. Moreover, Twitter is especially interesting to politicians, because it allows them to individually communicate their positions on a daily basis [@neubergerInternetJournalismusVomTraditionellen2010]. In contrast, other communication options are limited due to the *gatekeeping* roles of political parties and media. It is not a candidate's decision whether they give the next big speech at a party event, or participate in a TV debate. They have to be endorsed by the party board or invited by the broadcasting network, a barrier between the politician and the public which Twitter essentially eliminates. As a consequence, Twitter acts as a more unrestricted space for political self-expression, revealing diversity within political parties and campaigns [@saeltzerBundestagswahl2021Auf2022]. This is significant when considering campaign strategies, as it is plausible that representatives (even from the same party) adopt unique approaches to campaigning.^[Besides the fact that Twitter, as one of the largest social media in which various people exchange information about politics and society, is logically a strong object of study for the political sciences, the platform also used to offer extremely liberal access to their data for academics, which made the extensive literature possible. This changed with Elon Musk's takeover of the platform in early 2023, which unfortunately resulted in the closure of easy data access — a regrettable development for the scientific community.]

In light of these factors, I aim to build upon the work of @crabtreeItNotOnly2020 and explore the sentiment expressed by candidates for the German Bundestag before and after the 2021 election. Thereby, I contribute to the literature on strategic emotive campaigning in multiparty systems. Before drafting the hypotheses, I provide a short description of the political landscape in Germany before the 2021 election.

### The 2021 German Federal Election
Coming off a 16-year chancellorship under Angela Merkel, the 2021 German Federal Election served as a turning point for the country [@deckerWahljahr20212021]. Her unprecedented decision not to rerun left room for an interesting campaign amongst the different parties. The previous coalition government was led by the CDU/CSU, known for its center-right conservatism, in partnership with the SPD, associated with center-left social democracy. The biggest party in the opposition was the Green Party, which gained considerable momentum before the election. For the first time, three parties (at least at some point) had a realistic chance of nominating the Chancellor. The other opposition parties - the FDP, advocating for (neo)liberalism and free-market policies; the Left Party, representing socialist and leftist views; and the AfD, a radical right nationalist party - all continued to play a key role in the party system. Figure `@ref(fig:partypositions)` in the Appendix provides a visual representation of the parties' positions on a left-right scale.^[For this I used the *Manifesto Data* provided by @lehmannManifestoProjectDataset2023.]

In general, the growth in complexity within the German party system resulted in a multifaceted campaign and government formation process [@debusParteienwettbewerbUndWahrscheinlichkeit2022]. Ultimately, the election led to a change of power with the SPD, Greens, and FDP forming the new government. On the 8th of December, Olaf Scholz was appointed as Chancellor, along with his cabinet, marking a new era in the German political landscape.

## Hypotheses {#hypotheses}
Building upon the theoretical framework, I formulate and present the hypotheses, which guide the empirical analysis of this work, in the subsequent section.

As outlined in [*section 2.1.1*](#emotivestrategies), representatives of incumbent parties (in this case CDU/CSU and SPD) intentionally frame the status quo in a positive light through their emotive language to influence the electorate's perception and voting-decision. Therefore I derive the following hypothesis:

\begin{center}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\textit{H1}]
    \item \textit{Incumbent parties utilize a greater degree of positive sentiment on Twitter than opposition parties.}\label{hypothesis:H1}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{center}

Expanding on this, the mechanism might be particularly pronounced within coalition governments for the party that puts forth the chancellor. When multiple parties constitute the government, voters attribute primary responsibility to the party with the most power in the coalition [@crabtreeItNotOnly2020; @debusEconomicVotingCoalition2014; @duchVoterPerceptionsAgenda2013]. Therefore, it is in the particular interest of this party to shape the voter's perception in favorable terms. In the context of the 2021 election, this mechanism might have been especially strong, as Angela Merkel governed the country for 16 years. Without doubt, voters largely associate her and the CDU/CSU with the country's status quo.
Accordingly, I formulate the second hypothesis:

\begin{center}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\textit{H2}]
    \item \textit{Parties leading a coalition utilize a greater degree of positive sentiment on Twitter compared to their coalition partners.}\label{hypothesis:H2}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{center}

Turning towards the sentiment of the opposition, the ideological positioning of a party seems to play a vital role in campaign strategies. With greater distance to the governing parties, the greater the likelihood of criticism towards them. In this regard, *Populist Radical Right Parties* (PRR's) are especially known for their distinctively negative language [@crabtreeItNotOnly2020, 1047]. They often position themselves as *anti-establishment* and express a sentiment rooted in nationalism, opposition to immigration, and a distrust of institutions [@crabtreeItNotOnly2020, 1047; @mayerTwoDimensionsNarcissistic2020, 60; @muddePopulistRadicalRight2007]. Therefore I propose that the candidates of the AfD, Germany's PRR, employ the most negative sentiment on Twitter. Consequently, the third hypothesis is:

\begin{center}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\textit{H3}]
    \item \textit{Compared to all other parties, radical right parties utilize the most negative sentiment on Twitter.}\label{hypothesis:H3}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{center}

Aside from party level characteristics, personal factors surely influence candidates strategic use of emotive language. The widespread stereotype that women are too emotional or cannot control their emotions [@durikEthnicityGenderStereotypes2006] influences the evaluation of female politicians. For instance, being labeled as emotional or being told to "*calm down*" has been shown to discredit female politicians [@frascaWordsWeaponsLabeling2022]. Aware and confronted with this stereotype, I expect female candidates to express less emotive language (positive or negative). Accordingly, the fourth hypothesis is:

\begin{center}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\textit{H4}]
    \item \textit{Female candidates utilize less emotional language compared to their male counterparts on Twitter.}\label{hypothesis:H4}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{center}

Finally, intra-party diversity might influence differing campaign strategies among the candidates. In previous literature, parties are often regarded as uniform actors, a focus which only recently shifted with scholars taking intra-party conflict and diversity into account [@greeneLeadershipCompetitionDisagreement2016, 611]. @saltzerFindingBirdWings2022, for instance, shows differences within German parties, where members of different factions express and position themselves differently. 
\newpage
Therefore, I expect candidates of the same party to also employ differing emotive language strategies. Subsequently, the fifth hypothesis is:

\begin{center}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\textit{H5}]
    \item \textit{Intra-party diversity leads to differing sentiment amidst a party's candidates on Twitter.}
  \end{enumerate}\label{hypothesis:H5}
\end{center}
