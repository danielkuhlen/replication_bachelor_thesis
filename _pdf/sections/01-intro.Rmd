# Introduction {#intro}

In a tweet dated 12th October 2020, Armin Laschet, who subsequently emerged as the CDU/CSU's chancellor candidate, stated: *"We are continuing to work on the transformation of our industry to climate neutrality. Today we discussed a hydrogen strategy with the CEOs of the major companies. Nowhere in Europe do better conditions exist for maintaining value chains.  #industry #steel #chemistry #nrw"*. In contrast, representing the Green Party, JÃ¼rgen Trittin shared markedly different remarks on the government's climate measures: *"It is not a feeling but to read every day. #Laschet and the CDU like CSU don't give a damn about the #climate crisis and social #inequality"*. From these tweets alone, even those unfamiliar with the German political system may discern the incumbent from the opposition. The messages could not be more different; while one highlights the progress and success, the other critiques that very status. Such distinctions suggest that a candidate's role profoundly shapes their campaign narrative.

In this regard, previous literature largely centered around *campaign content*, which concerns political themes and issues, as well as *campaign focus*, which examines whether the emphasis is on oneself or the opponent [@crabtreeItNotOnly2020: 1046]. However, beyond these, candidates also employ emotional tactics to resonate with and persuade voters [@braderCampaigningHeartsMinds2006]. According to the retrospective voting behavior theory, when citizens cast their votes, they do not solely consider the parties' future plans but also critically assess the country's prevailing status quo [@keyResponsibleElectorateRationality1966]. In the case of a positive perception, they are more likely to support the incumbent party, while a negative one tends to sway them towards the opposition [@plesciaRetrospectiveVotingParty2017]. Being aware of this mechanism politicians are incentivized to influence perceptions of the status quo to their advantage [@vavreckMessageMattersEconomy2009]. @crabtreeItNotOnly2020 suggest that one avenue they pursue for this is the use of emotional language. To test this they provide a theoretical framework and comparatively analyze the sentiment employed in party manifestos. I argue that it is campaign outlets, such as televised debates, public speeches, and social media, that shape the electorate's perception of the status quo rather than party manifestos. Therefore I expand their work by studying candidates' emotional strategies on Twitter around the 2021 German federal election with the sentiment dictionary for German political text and speech provided by @rauhValidatingSentimentDictionary2018.

Through this, I contribute to the growing literature on strategic emotions in electioneering and provide new insights into: (1) strategic emotions not only at the party level but candidate level, (2) their trends throughout different phases of the electoral cycle, and (3) the validity of dictionary-based approaches for tweeted text in electioneering.

First, I outline the theoretical argument, provide some contextual information regarding the election and parties, and subsequently derive my hypotheses. Second, I describe the data's structure and present the methodological approach. Third, I present my findings, discuss the weak points of the analysis and provide an extensive reflection on the use of dictionary-based approaches for analyzing political tweets.
